See the sun set
The day is ending
Let that yawn out
There's no pretending
I will hold you
And protect you
So let love warm you
Till the morning
I'll stay with you
By your side
Close your tired eyes
I'll wait and soon
I'll see your smile
In our dream
And I won't wake before you go
And I still hear your heart beat
Feel the wind rise
A dawn we're bound to
Watch that star die
Eons without you
I'll stay with you
In your mind
Every single day
I'll wait and soon
We're stranded on the beach
In our dream
We left too soon
But in our lies
There's a truth to find
The end is new
A tomorrow we must reach for
To be heard
See the sun set
The day is ending
Let your heart sigh
See the sun set
See the sun set
Try to stay with you
Oh I won't stray away from the truth
And I
Love anew
And I still want you let
Own you
And I oooh oohhh

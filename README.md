See the sun set<br>
The day is ending<br>
Let that yawn out<br>
There's no pretending<br>
I will hold you<br>
And protect you<br>
So let love warm you<br>
Till the morning<br>
I'll stay with you<br>
By your side<br>
Close your tired eyes<br>
I'll wait and soon<br>
I'll see your smile<br>
In our dream<br>
And I won't wake before you go<br>
And I still hear your heart beat<br>
Feel the wind rise<br>
A dawn we're bound to<br>
Watch that star die<br>
Eons without you<br>
I'll stay with you<br>
In your mind<br>
Every single day<br>
I'll wait and soon<br>
We're stranded on the beach<br>
In our dream<br>
We left too soon<br>
But in our lies<br>
There's a truth to find<br>
The end is new<br>
A tomorrow we must reach for<br>
To be heard<br>
See the sun set<br>
The day is ending<br>
Let your heart sigh<br>
See the sun set<br>
See the sun set<br>
Try to stay with you<br>
Oh I won't stray away from the truth<br>
And I<br>
Love anew<br>
And I still want you let<br>
Own you<br>
And I oooh oohhh<br>
